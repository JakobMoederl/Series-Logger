# Series-Logger
A WebExtension that keeps track of all the episodes you watch.

this extension is still under development. it is intended to be the succesor of "kinox tv series master" (only avialable for firefox)
the first websites are be bs.to and onwatchseries.to. i'm planning on adding movie4k and kinox soon.
if you wan't any other websites let me know in the comments on the github-project (https://github.com/JakobMoederl/Series-Logger.git) or the addon page
